# Twitter Bot Template

Boilerplate for creating simple, non-interactive twitter bots that post periodically.

## Instructions

To make a bot, copy this repo and run `./start.sh` to create
a virtualenv and settings file.

When you're done (or at a stop-and-test point) developing your bot,
run `ready.sh` to set up the python package and run tests.

To start tweeting on a schedule, run `python cron_lines.py` to generate
the lines you'll need to add to cron.
